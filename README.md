Figure3 the propose model

To ensure optimal performance for each fold, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was independently conducted for every fold using the training data. The optimization utilized the Optuna 3 framework with the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) as the sampler.  
For your convenience, I've integrated all the code into train1.py so you can run it directly
